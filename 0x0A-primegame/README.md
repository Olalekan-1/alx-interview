Prime Game Module

This module provides functionality to determine the winner of a
game played between two players, Maria and Ben, using a set of
consecutive integers starting from 1 up to and including n.
They take turns choosing a prime number from the set and
removing that number and its multiples from the set.
The player who cannot make a move loses the game.
The module includes a function to determine the overall
winner after playing multiple rounds.
